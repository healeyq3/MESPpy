# Maximum-Entropy Sampling

Updated 10/30/23

See test2.py - framework is solving instance s=10 with (from as far as I'm aware) fastest runtime seen. 

I just finished rewriting the variable fixing code. Will finish incorporating that with tree solver tomorrow, and then will run experiments for $s \in \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50\}$.
