# Maximum-Entropy Sampling

Updated 10/12/23

I have officially started rebuilding the Branch and Bound framework, which now incorporates the subproblem shrinking code. This logic is primarily held in the Node class (node.py file). Tomorrow (Friday 10/13) will be entirely focused on finishing this initial build out, hopefully concluding with a test.

The localsearch still works, but do not try to run anything related to the B&B framework - it is not complete.
